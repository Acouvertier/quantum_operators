# quantum_operators
A python library used to calculate commutator relationships for position/momentum, annihilation/creation, and spin SU(2) operators. Relevant for automating solutions to Heisenberg Equations of Motions and checking by-hand calculations. Future work to be done includes: exports of resulting combinations to callable functions for scipy and numpy.
